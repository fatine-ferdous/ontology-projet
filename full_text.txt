Foreword
The Future is Designed
by Those Who Dare
Mohammad Abdullah Al Gergawi
Vice Chairman of the Board of Trustees & Managing Director,
Dubai Future Foundation
Shaping the future is not just a choice – it is a responsibility. Only
those bold enough to design tomorrow are the ones who lead today.
This has never been more true than in our era of rapid advancement,
where evolving realities bring both complex challenges and
extraordinary opportunities.
Indeed, the profound economic, social, and environmental shifts
our world has witnessed in recent years have redefined the way we
perceive progress. These transformations form the foundation of
the fourth edition of The Global 50 report, which highlights 50 new
opportunities driven by advancements in technology, the digital
economy, artificial intelligence, materials science, bioengineering,
and other fields that are redrawing the boundaries of possibility.
This report serves as a roadmap for leveraging these opportunities,
focusing on improving health, restoring natural balance, enhancing
sustainability, empowering communities, and driving future
innovations.
This report also outlines the 10 megatrends shaping our world today
– helping us prepare for what lies ahead and seize the opportunities
that emerge from these shifts.
Through this research, we aim to fuel innovation, inspire decision-
makers, and drive governments, institutions, and individuals towards
a clear vision for a brighter future for humanity. Ultimately, innovation
does not happen in isolation; it requires bold leadership, effective
partnerships, and agile institutions that can adapt and act swiftly.
When vision meets action, and imagination translates into execution,
dreams turn into reality – what were once ambitions become
achievements. Indeed, the future belongs to those who create it –
and this is an invitation to lead in shaping what comes next.

Introduction
Introduction
Our understanding of progress
will continue to evolve.
We will need to reflect on and adapt to what we think meaningful progress
looks like.1 However, as the world moves towards more complexity,2 and
in an era of quantum shifts (see Box 1), change happens very quickly,3
making foresight both increasingly more challenging and more important
than ever.
But, this raises an important question. Has it not always been an era of
quantum shifts?
BOX 1
The Era of Quantum Shifts4
The term ‘quantum’ originates from quantum theory, describing
the simultaneous and continuous transitions between energy states
at the atomic and subatomic levels. It includes the concepts of
‘entanglement’ and ‘superposition’ where behaviours of particles
can remain correlated and connected even when they are changing
and far away from each other.
The Global 50 uses the concept of ‘quantum’ to represent the
rapid, disruptive and dramatic changes that may shape the future
of business, communications, culture, government, medicine,
technology and other domains. We also use it to acknowledge the
intertwined, complex relationships and interconnections that will
determine how the future unfolds. The Global 50 also uses ‘shifts’
to characterise how the same forces can drive societies in opposite
directions, and the same innovations may either enable societies to
move forward or prevent them from doing so.
Our era is characterised by such ‘quantum shifts’.

We have often heard
that change is the

human history.

However, there are indicators that technological change
is accelerating (see Box 2), pushing the boundaries in
many areas of daily work and life, economies and society,
sometimes with little or no notice.

Whereas in our ancient past we tended to live within communities of
50 to 150 people, 4.4 billion (more than half of the global population)
now live in large cities with thousands of neighbours, yet loneliness is a
growing global concern.24 Generation Z (born 1997–201225) are lowering
their career goals and delaying home ownership, relationships and
starting a family because of the rising cost of living.26 Together with
technological advances, these drivers will influence our thoughts about
what a meaningful and good life looks like.

10 The Global 50 (2025)

Introduction
In this edition of The Global 50, we again explore the key pillars that
make up our view of the future. While the pillars have not changed,
we have introduced a new assumption about global interdependencies
that we had initially alluded to in our report Navigating the Future for
Growth, Prosperity and Well-Being: The Foundation of The Global 50
Report in 2023.27 In addition, and taking the long view,a we used the
uncertainties and the research conducted for this edition to explore
a set of scenarios that are most likely to impact future growth,
prosperity and well-being along with how industries may evolve.
Additionally, and noting the dynamic nature of the megatrends, Saving
Ecosystems has been reworded into Evolving Ecosystems to include
the renewed or new focus on regeneration in many ecosystems.
In this edition of The Global 50, and to empower action within
foresight, we once again share 50 new opportunities as in the previous
editions, that cover ways to adapt, disrupt and innovate for future
growth, prosperity and well-being. With the 50 opportunities in each
of the 2022, 2023 and 2024 editions of The Global 50, readers now
have 200 opportunities to consider that could inspire over 1,000 ideas
and initiatives, whether economic, legal, societal, technological or
a combination of all four.
The next 50 years are set to bring both opportunities and challenges
for all generations. By exploring potential futures and imagining new
possibilities, we can take proactive steps to navigate uncertainties,
benefit from the opportunities, and mitigate the risks.
a Looking beyond 30 years.
11 The Global 50 (2025)

Our View of the Future
Our View
of the Future
Our view of the future is built
upon four pillars: assumptions,
uncertainties, megatrends and,
by covering how to navigate
The Global 50, action.
While establishing a view of the future helps achieve future readiness,
it is through action that the impacts of foresight are realised.
Thinking about and planning for the future is not straightforward.28
Our view of the future provides us – and readers – with a conceptual
model for navigating the era of quantum shifts. It can help find new
ways to meet our basic needs and fulfil our desire for self-realisation
in the diverse and constantly changing realities that the world faces
today and will face tomorrow.29 The assumptions and uncertainties will
be relevant over multiple decades, while the megatrends are relevant
only over the next decade or so and are continuously evolving.30
While the four pillars of our view of the future are presented in silos,
they are interrelated. The role of foresight, strategy or innovation
professionals is to translate complex future possibilities into
actionable insights, exploring scenarios and narratives that help
nations, organisations and individuals prepare for multiple futures
while building strategic capabilities.31
12 The Global 50 (2025)

Our View of the Future Assumptions
Our View of the Future
Assumptions
As the foundational aspects
informing our thinking about
the future of growth, prosperity
and well-being, assumptions
apply over several decades.
Any shifts in the assumptions could substantially change the future
scenarios built on them and our ability to realise future opportunities.
As mentioned, this year we have introduced a new assumption
(see Box 4), which is based on our earlier work32 and further
supported by the research carried out this year. As we take the long
view on assumptions, we recognise that related signals may shift in
the short term due to unforeseen events, which may or may not have
a lasting impact.
13 The Global 50 (2025)

Our View of the Future Assumptions
BOX 4
New Assumption
Global Interdependencies
Will Remain
This assumption is linked to two key drivers: increasing technological
interdependencies and expanding resource dependencies (i.e.
between people, minerals and commodities).33 Various technologies
and infrastructures around the world depend on each other, whether
in terms of their hardware, their software or their storage (including
energy needs). Economically, trade is not just about manufactured
goods – it is also about information, natural resources, agriculture,
services, R&D, finance, patents and many others.34 The cross-border
connections are deep and intricate, including societal ones.35 Even
if we see increasing localisation, such as reshoring,36 this will still
happen within a reality of deep interdependencies.

Our View of the Future
Uncertainties
The future is uncertain. However, by identifying and navigating the
specific ways in which it is uncertain, we can identify potential outcomes
that may impact our future growth, prosperity and well-being either
positively or negatively. Like assumptions, uncertainties apply over
multiple decades, and each year for The Global 50 we validate and
refine (where needed) the five uncertainties (see Box 5).

20 The Global 50 (2025)

Our View of the Future Uncertainties
The uncertainties reflect the vastly divergent
socio-economic, political and environmental
conditions that global societies may experience.
Although the uncertainties themselves are not novel, they manifest
into new challenges within evolving realities. Meeting the expectations
of global societies will require a nuanced understanding of the
multifaceted uncertainties and landscapes shaping our shared future,
which foresight can help address.
Imagining the future is at the heart of foresight and is particularly
impactful in times of uncertainty, when clarity is important.73 It is
impactful because it helps us imagine futures in ways that we may not
instinctively think of, aiding our creative thinking about opportunities
and challenges and helping us to set a strategic direction and take
action. Part of imagining the future involves developing scenarios.
Scenarios often fall into three broad types: predictive, exploratory
and normative. Whereas predictive scenarios are solely focused on
developing outlooks based on information that is available today (e.g.
forecasting), exploratory scenarios define possible futures based on a
set of assumptions and drivers.74 In the middle sit normative scenarios,
which take into account information today but also goals for tomorrow,
with the aim of uncovering pathways to preferable future(s)75 in a
process often referred to as backcasting.
As scenario building can be both a strategic planning tool76 and
a research method,77 scenarios are used by practitioners, strategy
professionals, and even researchers to uncover underlying thoughts
and assumptions, improve understanding, and extract insights on
a particular topic.
21 The Global 50 (2025)

Our View of the Future Uncertainties
Taking the long view,e and in this year’s edition of The Global
50, we used the assumptions and uncertainties along with the
research carried out to develop exploratory scenarios of future
growth, prosperity and well-being. While specific outcomes will
vary based on local conditions, these global scenarios are designed to
prompt reflection and deeper analysis. These four scenarios are not
exhaustive and the Dubai Future Foundation welcomes debate and
discussion to refine them further.
Based on our research, technology
and nature will have the greatest
impact on future growth, prosperity
and well-being and, hence, are
critical uncertainties.

Our View of the Future Uncertainties
Today
Understanding the present provides context for how each future scenario
may unfold. While many signals are discussed throughout this, and
previous, editions of The Global 50 report within both the megatrends
and opportunities sections, several key themes can be used to
characterise the present.
While the global economy has maintained stability since the COVID-19
pandemic,78 a question remains about how we will manage evolving
matters, from redefining value and wealth while adapting to new forms
of monetary exchange including cryptocurrencies79 and addressing the
financial needs of low- and middle-income countries,80 to expanding
economic metrics beyond gross domestic product (GDP)81 and the
evolving shape of future economic growth.82 Although many remain
optimistic about technology’s continued role in improving our lives,83
concerns persist.84 The development of artificial intelligence (AI)
regulatory frameworks85 and collaborative international efforts, such as
the United Nations Declaration on Future Generations, the Global Digital
Compact, and the Pact for the Future,86 suggest a commitment to quality
of life as a priority. However, challenges remain, including attaining
equitable access to advanced connectivity,87 energy and food and water
around the world. While biotechnology holds great promise for improving
food systems88 and healthcare,89 societies continue to deal with issues
related to loneliness,90 mental health,91 bottlenecks in healthcare
systems,92 food waste and lack of access.93 Many countries and cities
have made environmental commitments and signed treaties related
to the environment,94 sea95 and space,96 but extreme weather patterns
and climate variability continue to be concerning97 and migration due to
climate may be inevitable.98
Five questions to consider for a preferable
future of growth, prosperity and well-being
1. How can human well-being and quality of life remain central to
technological advances and innovation?
2. What technologies and strategies can provide clear visibility in
critical raw materials, ecosystem health, and biodiversity?
3. What legal frameworks, governance mechanisms, and progress
indicators are needed to ensure global commitment to closing
digital, economic, energy, food and health divides?
4. How can innovations remain accessible and affordable for all while
adapting to and addressing the impacts of climate shifts?
5. How can investments and funding models be secured to make
these goals achievable?

A New Era
This is the preferable future
In this scenario, technology, innovation and environmental restoration
usher in a new era of growth and well-being. People live healthier,
fulfilling lives as sustainable technologies enable more equitable access
to optimised resources. Ecosystems are responding positively to
innovation and science, biodiversity is restored, and climate resilience
improves, providing clean air, water and food security. However, inherent
challenges like inequality will persist, pushing the need for focused
efforts for inclusive progress despite broader societal progress.
Growth
Technology drives sustainable growth beyond GDP metrics, creating a
diversified economy that balances environmental and human prosperity.
Prosperity
Technology enables broader access to essential resources, energy and
food, although equal distribution remains an ongoing challenge.
Well-being

On the Edge
In this scenario, while technology generates uneven economic gains
through enhanced productivity, worsening climate impacts intensify
environmental stress and societal challenges. Climate change accelerates,
straining ecosystems and deepening inequality. Resource shortages and
environmental degradation drive increasing climate migration, affecting
even prosperous regions. Disparities widen between technology-rich areas
and vulnerable communities, creating a striking divide in quality of life.
Growth
Environmental decline and resource scarcity undermine economic gains
from technology, destabilising long-term growth.
Prosperity
Technology brings progress to some, while climate impacts and resource
shortages disproportionately burden poorer communities.

Our View of the Future Uncertainties
A Balancing Act
In this scenario, technological advancement and ecological restoration
create mixed outcomes and uneven sectoral growth with first-movers
gaining significant advantage. While innovations in renewable energy
and ecosystem regeneration drive ecological prosperity, the focus
on economic efficiency over societal needs or quality of life creates
uneven benefits that lead to deep societal divides and well-being gaps
between communities. Nature responds positively to restoration efforts,
but tension grows between profit-driven technology deployment and
human-centred development.
Growth
Innovation drives sustainable economic growth, while restored
ecosystems provide stable natural resources and opportunities.
Prosperity
Technology and ecological health create prosperity, although benefits
remain unevenly distributed across communities.
Well-being
Environmental restoration and technological advances improve well-
being where available, but access remains inconsistent.

over environment and societal costs. While some regions prosper,
environmental degradation and global inequalities deepen.
Accelerating climate impacts and natural resource scarcity lead to
widespread climate migration and social instability that undermines
global cooperation when it is needed most.
Growth
Economic growth declines as environmental degradation lowers
productivity, making investments riskier and development uneven.

A note on industries
in the future
Sectors and industries are already transforming their supply
chains for future resilience and sustainability.99 Drawing
on lessons from past disruptions such as the COVID-19
pandemic, market volatility, data security breaches,100 and the
growing prevalence in the past decade of misinformation and
disinformation,101 many are putting plans in place to respond to
emerging opportunities and challenges.
However, future scenarios for growth, prosperity and well-being
will also impact industries. In particular, a focus on a preferable
future of growth, prosperity and well-being (i.e. the ‘A New Era’
scenario) means working towards processes and technologies
that improve quality of life and enhance collaboration across
sectors while building sustainable, restorative and regenerative
ecosystems.102 Consequently, future industries will need to
balance the tensions between local and global interpretations of
progress – in areas such as longevity, economic inclusion and
opportunity, natural and critical resources, and sustainability
– while navigating the need for, and trade-offs between,
technologies of scale and scope.f
f Technologies of scale refer to technologies that are widely adopted across diverse
contexts and are generally applicable. Technologies of scope refer to technologies that
are tailored to a specific context and targeted opportunity or challenge.

PERMANENT MAGNETS
2X
Permanent magnets – as rare earth elements – contribute to efforts towards the clean energy
2024 - 2050 transition and to reaching net zero.115 Permanent magnets convert energy from turning
wind turbines into electricity.116 Permanent magnets in electric vehicles convert energy from
2X
batteries into torque in motors117 and can save 20–40% of energy versus non-magnet motors.118
2015 - 2023 In fusion energy power plants, strong magnetic fields can regulate plasma at temperatures
higher than the Sun’s core.119 Magnets are also used in healthcare (e.g. magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI),120 transcranial magnetic stimulation121) and consumer electronics.122 Eighty-five
per cent of magnet mining is concentrated in China.123
However, the demand for permanent magnets doubled between 2015 and 2023124 and is
expected to nearly double between 2024 and 2050.125 To meet this demand, alternative
materials will be needed. For example, researchers are exploring rare-earth-free permanent
magnets, such as those using iron nitride (FeN), as long as – in the case of electric vehicles
– motor performance is maintained.126 Using artificial intelligence (AI), King’s College
London has developed an iron-based superconducting magnet, which could be a significant
breakthrough in creating cost-effective MRI machines.127
BIOMIMETIC MATERIALS
Biomimetic materials are materials that are made by humans but inspired by nature, either in
their properties or how they function.128 Biomimetics is currently contributing to advances in
various fields, including science, engineering and medicine.129 Nature – resilient over billions
of years130 – offers efficient and sustainable approaches to the challenges we face.

CYBERBIOSECURITY AWARENESS
AND EDUCATION
Low Besides data privacy risks, there are two major threats unique to cyberbiosecurity. One is
cyberbiosecurity cyber-physical (i.e. sabotage of machines and equipment used in biological research, or
awareness theft of data) and the other is the creation of dangerous biological materials using digital
particularly in
information.199 This is particularly relevant in biobanks200 and other repositories of genetic
Southeast Asia
samples and data where genetic information can be accessed and manipulated digitally,
making it possible to create synthetic DNA and even reconstruct dangerous pathogens using
published sequences.201
Awareness of cyberbiosecurity remains low around the world and some regions are
less prepared than others, particularly the countries of Southeast Asia.202 Irrespective
of regulations, it is essential to raise awareness of cyberbiosecurity threats among
biotechnology companies, research institutions, and policymakers through education
and training, ensuring that researchers and practitioners from all relevant disciplines are
involved.203 One initiative to note is the Biological Security Research Centre at London
Metropolitan University,204 which established the International Biological Security Education
Network in 2024.205
BALANCING INTEROPERABILITY
WITH CYBERSECURITY
Cybersecurity is a global, cross-border challenge, and interoperability (the ability of systems
to work together) can be both a challenge for, and a solution to, cybersecurity. As the world
becomes more interconnected, particularly when it comes to data flows,206 innovative
approaches to cybersecurity are increasingly needed.
In 2023, the average time to identify and contain a breach was 258 days.207 This time could
be reduced by improving interoperability (often through common security standards and
protocols), enhancing overall security and embracing collaborations between entities
and nations.208 For example, on an international scale, Estonia’s cross-border electronic
governance system X-Road is used in other countries (including several of the Nordics)
to deliver security, services and economic benefits,209 capturing both interoperability and
cybersecurity benefits.

GAME THEORY FOR
THE GLOBAL PATH TO NET ZERO
The global net-zero economy is targeting carbon neutrality by 2050 and it is estimated
that this will require approximately $275 trillion in capital spending, with an average annual
investment of $9.2 trillion and reaching a peak of 8.8% of global gross domestic product
between 2026 and 2030.223 However, reaching this goal is not straightforward as many
aspects come into play.
Game theory is a model for interactive decision-making where the outcomes depend on
anticipating the strategies and associated decisions of others.224 The use of game theory in
relation to energy is not new; it has been used to model and optimise interactions between
stakeholders within the complex energy system.225 Applied to net zero, game theory can

While not the most significant, hydrogen is part of the future clean energy mix. In 2023, the
use of hydrogen in new clean energy applications rose by 40% but still accounted for less
than 1% of global hydrogen demand, which is expected to continue growing, driven by new
applications in power and transport.233 At the same time, by 2030, demand for low-emissions
hydrogen is expected to reach only 10% of what is needed for net zero by 2050,234 requiring
significant advances in hydrogen fuel cells and infrastructure.235
Electrolysers, essential for hydrogen production, rely on materials such as platinum. In 2023,
only 22% of installed capacity used the more efficient platinum-based proton exchange
membranes,236 a technology that has the potential to provide 11% of the global carbon dioxide

challenges, exacerbating future supply risks.239 Promising alternative materials that maintain
efficient energy conversion and storage capabilities include noble metal alloys, transition

further by focusing on restoring natural resources, enhancing biodiversity, and rejuvenating
damaged ecosystems.253
As a result, the idea of regeneration has spread to other domains.254 For example, in medicine,
there is increasing recognition that the human body can heal itself.255 In agriculture, farmers
are rehabilitating the soil, respecting animal welfare, and building healthier communities
while improving their yields.256 Making efforts to restore and improve ecosystems in day-to-
day living,257 regenerative tourism, long-term community, and environmental enrichment are
increasingly prioritised over immediate returns.258
ACOUSTIC ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE FOR ECOSYSTEMS
AI with acoustics holds potential in understanding and improving marine, wildlife, urban
and other ecosystems. Underwater sound travels further than visual signals or scents and
is critical for marine life communication, migration and interaction with the environment.259
AI has already been successfully used to monitor whale vocalisations, improving species
detection and marine conservation strategies.260
Recent studies on AI and wildlife have focused on birds (48%) and mammals (22%),261 but
issues include insufficient datasets, high background noise, lack of standardisation, and
complex sound classifications. While maintaining wildlife welfare and being aware of potential
AI bias, AI may provide valuable real-time insights for conservation.262
AI is also helping to optimise room acoustics, urban noise monitoring, studio recordings,
and speech clarity in educational environments.263 From workplaces to healthcare, AI and
acoustics can boost productivity and creativity, with Internet of Things (IoT) integration and
advanced signal processing enhancing auditory experiences and immersive
sound environments.264

However, digital assets lack a universal definition289 despite the fact that two-thirds of 86
jurisdictions surveyed by the World Economic Forum already regulate or are planning to

The home entertainment and impact of technology has also been transformative in drama and the arts. With technological
cinema markets were worth advances, new forms of theatre have emerged that encourage viewers to actively participate

productions to document knowledge for use in drama education in the future.331
Many performing arts theatres, some of which had never previously offered digital broadcasts,
billion made their performances available online during the COVID-19 pandemic.332 For example,
National Theatre at Home,333 launched during the pandemic, attracted over 15 million viewers
from 170 countries within just four months of launch.334 Facing challenges bringing back
audiences to pre-COVID levels,335 digital realities can enhance access and enable distant
in 2023 audiences to attend live performances or feel like they are part of a live performance.
THE VIRTUAL–REAL SELF DIVIDE
The boundary between our real and virtual identities continues to be blurred. People may
maintain multiple identities across various platforms, raising philosophical and ethical
questions about what it means to be human and what physical existence or being present
or conscious means.336 Key questions include what information can be shared in the virtual
self, how to ensure privacy, who is accountable for errors or decisions in the virtual life that
may or may not impact real-life experiences, and how to balance regulation to promote both
trust and freedom in the virtual world.337
How virtual and real identities influence each other remains a crucial area of research,338
building on previous studies that have focused on the relationship between the actual
and idealised self 339 and how they can enhance societal prosperity and well-being. For
example, participating in virtual environments can have positive effects when virtual and
real identities are aligned. However, it can also create the feeling of being disconnected if the
virtual self is seen as superior, negatively impacting self-esteem and life satisfaction.340

BIOMIMICRY FOR SOFT ROBOTICS
Biomimicry draws inspiration from nature to enhance quality and functionality across
domains and offer innovative solutions to global challenges. Soft robotics, a high-potential
application of biomimicry, focuses on the development of adaptable robots made of materials
that feel like biological tissue. Bionic multi-legged robots with flexible bodies outperform rigid
robots in speed, stability, and terrain navigation,363 and gecko-inspired robots can achieve an
adhesion force of 180N, allowing them to climb and operate in microgravity environments.364
The development of bio-inspired soft robots requires several elements to be considered,
including materials, actuation mechanisms, and design. Highly interrelated, as they are in
biological systems,365 bio-inspired soft robots are key in medical applications, where precision
and reliability can be critical to the preservation of life.366 Interdisciplinary collaboration
between biologists and engineers will drive future innovation, deepening understanding of
biological systems while advancing robotics capabilities to produce more sophisticated,
versatile and lifelike robotic solutions.

Robots are increasingly used in manufacturing, scientific research, agriculture, and food
service. The development of larger numbers of collaborative robots (cobots) and humanoid
robots signals a shift towards more adaptable robots that can work alongside humans in
varied environments.
However, widespread adoption faces several obstacles. Safety concerns, regulatory
requirements, the impact on jobs, and resource constraints make scalable adoption

and robots will become crucial for successful integration. This challenge encompasses both
technical reliability and the more complex emotional aspects of human–robot collaboration,
setting the stage for future developments in the field.
BETTER MANUFACTURING MEASURED

Evolving from rapid prototyping, additive manufacturing is distinct from traditional linear
manufacturing. Similar to 3D printing, objects are built layer by layer,372 enabling the
manufacture of more complicated designs373 and without retooling.374 Materials, including
polymers, metals, ceramics, sand and composites,375 will be critical in scaling additive
manufacturing.376
Cooperative robots377 could be the catalyst for widespread adoption of additive
manufacturing.378 They could enhance printing capabilities, assist throughout the printing
process, and enable real-time information capture and feedback beyond the limitations of
single robotic systems.379 Their effectiveness would rely on sophisticated planning, collision
avoidance technology, and enhancement of the properties of relevant materials, augmented
by AI and machine learning technologies.380 Beyond technical capabilities, the key to success
will lie in how the quality of the collaboration is assessed in real time.381 In this way, the use of
cooperative robots in additive manufacturing may reveal a new frontier in
manufacturing innovation.

We define foresight as the
process of exploring futures to
inform decisions and actions today.
Presented in two parts, the primary aim of The Global 50 is to share
the Dubai Future Foundation’s view of the future when it comes to
growth, prosperity and well-being and some of the ways that this view
can be translated into action through 50 future opportunities. This
is complemented by a user-friendly web page that allows readers to
search through the opportunities and extract insights that align with
their individual goals and aims for reading the report.

Navigating The Global 50 Report As a Use Case for Foresight Research
As a Use Case
for Foresight Research
Quality is central to research in any domain.463 With common
quality principles, specific quality criteria depend on whether the
research is qualitative,464 quantitative, or mixed methods.465 Views
on what constitutes impactful research are diverse as well,466 with
increasing calls to move beyond criteria focused solely on quantity.467
Instead, quality of research is increasingly being evaluated – even
if informally – through demonstrable value for readers, practical
relevance for researchers, practitioners and decision-makers, ability
to offer solutions to societal challenges, originality, and theoretical or
analytical rigour.468
When research includes a futures component, quality considerations
expand with particular emphasis on methodology and execution
to avoid flawed future scenarios, unreliable projections, or a
narrow view of potential futures. High-quality foresight research
acknowledges varied and alternative futures, employs methods that
align with the researcher’s or organisation’s research philosophy,
regularly reassesses scenarios as circumstances evolve, and
considers both near- and long-term futures469 with extensive
reflexivity on underlying assumptions.
Foresight research encompasses various types of futures – from
probable, plausible and possible to predicted, projected and
preferred.470 It can incorporate multiple methodologies, including
backcasting, case studies, forecasts, interviews, meta-analysis,
scenarios, simulations, and trend analysis, among others.

Building on research and analysis carried out since 2021, our
approach forming our view of the future uses annual deductive
research methods to validate assumptions, uncertainties and
megatrends. When it comes to the opportunities, and to ensure
trustworthiness,471 we upheld the principles of credibility, through
thorough data verification; transferability, through detailed
contextual description; dependability, through consistent
methodological processes; confirmability, through transparent
documentation; and authenticity, in representing different
perspectives, translating into the following aspects of our research:

GenAI enhances our research
process but does not replace the
critical role that people still play
in knowledge production.
People remain central to improving quality, addressing bias, and
generating innovative outputs that, ultimately, refine large language
models (LLMs). At their core, LLMs rely on original research and
critical thought. As the pursuit of knowledge and research evolves,
advances in artificial intelligence (AI) – what we refer to as advanced
machine intelligence when taking the long view – will serve
humanity. As a branch of that field, GenAI for research will evolve
effectively as long as cognitive health, creativity and out-of-the-
box thinking, research quality, and researcher reflexivity remain
central to the evolving landscape.

Navigating The Global 50 Report For Strategic Foresight
For Strategic Foresight
Approaching The Global 50 from a strategic foresight perspective
is about exploring and monitoring signals, trends, disruptions,
megatrends and scenarios to extract insights. It is also about
translating these insights into actionable decisions and policies.
The Global 50 (in all four editions) supports both aspects as it presents
both a view of the future and future opportunities.
For organisations that do not have an established foresight
function, our view of the future can be used as a blueprint for
developing one with a focus on future growth, prosperity and well-
being. Using the uncertainties, assumptions and megatrends as the
pillars of our view of the future, organisations can establish a starting
set of signals or areas of review to scan the environment and explore
scenarios relevant to their specific sector, domain or objectives.
For organisations that do have an established foresight function,
The Global 50 offers a perspective from the Middle East and North
Africa region both informed by – and contributing to – global insights
on the future of growth, prosperity and well-being and can be used to
broaden or enhance strategic foresight activities.
In both cases, the assumptions, uncertainties, and megatrends can
be used to stress-test strategies472 and support future-oriented impact
evaluations.473 The opportunities can serve as a prompt or inspiration
for ideation and innovation.

While assumptions and uncertainties shape our long view of
the future, the megatrends provide guidance for the near- to
medium-term outlook. In navigating our view of the future, we
refer back to the Guiding Principles for navigating the era of
quantum shifts introduced in 2023.474
Guiding Principles for Navigating
the Era of Quantum Shifts475
1 How are people’s expectations – globally and in your own context –
changing and what new risks and opportunities will they face in their
daily lives?
2 Technological progress is hard to predict. However, in addition to
drawing on the assumptions in this report, what technological
advances do you anticipate may play significant roles in your own
context’s growth and development?
3 Which aspects of the uncertainties are you already well equipped
to face, and which will require new capacities or fresh solutions? Will
the future scenarios and industries of the future enable or hinder your
long-term vision?
4 Which global megatrends could have the greatest impact on models
of work and life in your own domain?
In doing so, readers can develop or inform strategies and initiatives
that focus on the future, benefiting from the opportunities and
mitigating associated risks relevant to their strategic vision and
mission. This can be part of their strategic, operational or risk
management plans.

The opportunities shared in this report are not exhaustive – they
present just some of the potential pathways to future growth,
prosperity and well-being. Some opportunities may seem more
relevant than others and some contexts will have the conditions in
place to share in the benefits while others may not. Similarly, the risks
associated with some opportunities might not be limited to those
countries or organisations acting on them, as risks often travel faster
than benefits.476 Some opportunities may be grounded in existing
technologies and systems, making them within reach, while others
are more aspirational and visionary. The main purpose of these
opportunities is to inspire ideation and innovation, illustrating foresight
in action and empowering creative thinking by offering readers
multiple ways to explore each opportunity – through uncertainties,
megatrends, trends, technologies, sectors and keywords.

Overall, each opportunity includes a question for the future with
a brief description that succinctly covers the essential aspects of
the opportunity. This approach aims to provide enough information
to spark curiosity and prompt further questions or thoughts that
can assist in decision-making about the opportunity’s relevance.
Additionally, for each opportunity we include a scope that may
be ‘within reach’, i.e. the opportunity is likely to be relevant within
two to three years, assuming the necessary conditions, systems
and technologies are in place. Where ‘transitional’ is specified,
the opportunity is likely to be relevant within 10 years and is tied to
advances in technology, and other conditions and enablers. Where
‘visionary’ is specified, the opportunity is likely to be relevant beyond
10 years, either because it will depend on technologies that are still
in the early stages of development or because it is part of a complex
system of drivers and other factors. Finally, each of the opportunities
includes a section titled Why It Matters Today, which highlights some
of the drivers that make the opportunity relevant for consideration
today, along with the future Opportunity and its associated Benefits
and Risks.

sitting just behind cancer –
at 10.5 million – as a leading ageing.494
cause of mortality worldwide
AMR also threatens the sustainability of agriculture, where it is
primarily driven by the misuse of antimicrobials. This results in
reduced animal health and welfare in food production, leading to
increased food insecurity, safety concerns, and economic losses
for farmers.495 A new report from the World Organisation for
Animal Health estimates that annual livestock production losses
due to AMR could equal the consumption needs of 746 million
people.496 In a more pessimistic scenario, this figure could rise to
around 2 billion people.497
Bacteriophage (also known as phage) therapy is not new. Phages
– viruses that infect and replicate within bacterial cells – have
proven effective against bacterial infections.498 Bacteriophages
were initially noted by British bacteriologist Ernest Hankin
in 1896 after he observed antibacterial effects in river water
in India. Frederick Twort and Félix d’Hérelle coined the term
‘bacteriophage’ following d’Hérelle’s pioneering use of phage
therapy in 1919.499

WHY IT MATTERS TODAY
While the global rural population today consists of 3.4 billion
people, it is projected to decline to 3.1 billion by 2050, with China
and India having the largest rural populations.510 In the Middle East
and North Africa, following a period of steady migration, only 37%
of the population lived in rural areas in 2023 compared with 66%
in 1960.511 Nevertheless, despite these reductions, the number of
people living in rural areas in the future will still be significant.
Rural residents are affected by chronic disease more than people
living in urban areas. In a study carried out in China in 2015, rural
residents had a higher prevalence of chronic disease than urban
residents, at nearly 83% and 80%, respectively.512 Similarly, in the
United States, the 46 million Americans (13.8% of the population)513
living in rural areas face higher rates of premature death from
heart disease, cancer, lung disease, and stroke.514
Implementing behavioural interventions for chronic disease
prevention in rural areas is often challenging.515 Due to technological
and staffing barriers, rural areas face a shortage of healthcare
specialists and primary care providers, and residents have limited
access to the network connectivity that could help them seek
healthcare remotely.516 Nearly 70% of people without internet
access (2.6 billion globally) live in rural areas.517

number of affected organs healthcare and the role of individual risk factors.527 In 2022, Ipsos
surveyed 1,160 people across the United States to predict how
well-being might change in a post-pandemic world. They found
that, for 62% of Americans, their health was more important to
them than before the pandemic528 and in 2024, their top concerns
are affordability, quality and future pandemics.529
Organ ageing rates vary and influence mortality risk, yet
methods to assess organ-specific ageing530 and predicting
disease risk remain limited.531 Two plasma proteomics studies
based on 45,000 and 50,000 samples (respectively) from
the UK Biobank found that certain proteins have a connection
to organ ageing.532, 533 Ageing organs can increase mortality
risk by 5.5 to 29 times, depending on the number of affected
organs.534 In a further study at Stanford University, researchers
used machine learning to analyse blood plasma proteins from
adults to estimate the biological age of 11 organs and body
systems including the arteries, brain, heart, intestines, kidneys,
liver and pancreas. It found that almost 20% of the participants
showed accelerated ageing in a single organ, while around 2%
had multiple ageing organs.535 People with accelerated heart
ageing had more than double the risk of heart failure over the
next 15 years. For most other organs, accelerated ageing led to
a 15–50% greater risk of death from any cause, while indicators
of brain and artery ageing were linked to a higher risk of
Alzheimer’s disease and cognitive decline.536

18%
High CR earlier in life lowers dementia risk by 18% and dementia
risk reduction is greater with education, particularly in primary
school.547 Higher CR in mid-life lowers dementia risk by 9%, with
particular benefits coming from job complexity, social interaction,
problem-solving, and data analysis.548 Higher CR in late life lowers
dementia risk by 19%, particularly through social connection.549
Physical activity throughout life shows beneficial effects on
cognitive health as well.550
While the impact of technology on cognitive health remains
understudied, especially as artificial intelligence (AI) reshapes daily
work and life,551 over-reliance on AI risks reduced metacognition
and other skill loss.552 Metacognitive skills – the ability to reflect on
how one thinks and completes tasks – are essential for effective
human–AI interaction,553 as deep reliance and dependence
on AI may diminish critical thinking and creativity554 as well as
weaken memory and spatial skills, raising concerns about ‘digital
dementia’ and structural brain changes.555 This is an emerging
area of research, but factors thought to promote cognitive health
include human oversight of AI instead of relying entirely on AI,
metacognitive skills training,556 and good dietary choices, such as
green, leafy vegetables, fatty fish, berries and walnuts.557

The risk of poor cognitive health may increase due to poor sleep
quality caused by excessive device use (five to eight hours

months of recovery560), and fungal infections such as Candida

that respond to stimuli and cause the 3D object to change over
time – emerged in 2013.661 Key applications of 4D printing include
soft robotics, toys and microtubes, and contexts that require
bending, twisting, lengthening and moving in wave-like patterns
as a result of environmental changes.662 Future applications
include self-healing bridges and expandable infrastructure, self-
tailored clothing and adaptive shoes, on-demand prosthetics and
smart implants, and even bone and tissue growth in regenerative
medicine.663 As a precursor to 4D printing, the global 3D-printing

rates of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, depression, dementia

Over 50% of the global population suffer from deficiencies in key

Fortification – the addition of nutrients – has been proven an
effective solution. Strategies include food fortification during

stories (e.g. iodine fortification in salt and iron fortification in
cereals) come with challenges, such as risk of thyr otoxicosis,

The market for minerals and vitamins is growing. The consumer
health and wellness market was valued at $1.8 trillion in
2023, growing annually by 5–10%, and personalisation will be

with heightened demand during the COVID-19 pandemic for
immune-boosting products. The market for these products
surged by 50% between 2018 and 2020, reaching $220 billion
in 2020, and is projected to reach just over $300 billion by

Cities consume a lot of energy. Globally, they are responsible for
approximately 75% of global energy consumption and 70% of
global greenhouse gas emissions, values which are predicted to

70% from approximately 56% today to around 70% by 2050.1037 Cities

emissions, values which are
predicted to increase nine (3,500 TWh) times more energy in 2050 compared with 2023
levels.1039
Renewable energy assets are a significant capital investment, and
effectively managing them is critical for energy security. The costs
of both solar photovoltaics (PV) and wind power technologies
continue to decrease. Between 2010 and 2023, solar PV costs
dropped 56% below fossil fuel and nuclear alternatives, reaching
4 cents per kWh,1040 while wind turbine costs fell by an average
of 53%.1041 Driven by emission reduction targets, energy security,
and strategic economic goals, demand will continue to increase.
Subject to supply chain interruptions and financing, investment
in energy are significant crossing $3 trillion in 2024, two-thirds of
which is allocated to clean energy.1042

Consumer product safety is important for society. According to the
2024 Report to the President and Congress, consumer products

and 3,595 deaths in 2023, involving appliances, home furnishings,
personal use items, sports equipment, toys and more.1069

to prevent cross-border distribution of unsafe products.1071 While
many high-income countries have established product safety laws,
enforcement institutions, and recall mechanisms, 60% of countries
(especially in Africa) lack experience in cross-border consumer
protection enforcement, exposing them to unsafe products.1072
In parallel, the expanding digital economy is creating both economic
opportunities and new safety challenges, particularly with the rise
of AI-enabled products. The digital economy is projected to create
70% of new value in the coming decade1073 and add $100 trillion to
the global economy by 2025.1074 The digital economy is expected
to expand at a rate six times faster than the traditional economy,
with the potential to account for 25% of global GDP in 2025.1075
AI-enabled devices are rapidly becoming more common (e.g. the
number of medical AI-enabled devices approved by the US Food

currently provides 9% of global electricity supply, with more
nuclear reactors also under construction.1123 Additionally, small

to electricity
outside China and Russia set to be implemented from 2030.1124
Global inequality is exacerbated by energy poverty. In 2023, 750

between 50 million and 125 million people are living in energy
poverty, highlighting the significant scale of this issue even in
wealthy regions.1126
Technology is at the heart of the future of energy.1127 From the
Internet of Things (IoT) and big data to AI and renewable energy
systems, technology is critical for improving energy infrastructure
quality and sustainability.1128 At the same time, while AI (for
example) can optimise approaches to the sustainable energy

Traditional geothermal energy holds promise (especially for net
zero) but is also a challenge. One study found that by repurposing
oil wells to produce geothermal energy,1163 carbon emissions can
be reduced by 34% compared with conventional geothermal.1164 At
the same time, geothermal power would need to grow by 13%
annually to meet net-zero emissions by 2050.1165 Additionally, the
capital costs of geothermal energy are high (despite the possibility
of achieving over 90% savings on operations).1166
Moreover, traditional geothermal energy systems typically use
convection methods, which requires either direct access to hot
aquifers or fracking to increase the permeability of rock. While
aquifers can be difficult to locate, fracking may induce seismic
activity,1167 limiting the possible locations for geothermal energy.

Transformational Innovation Beyond Borders
WHY IT MATTERS TODAY
While traditional approaches to aid have contributed to global
development, there are opportunities to enhance outcomes.
Only 49% of World Bank development projects were rated as
satisfactory or higher in achieving their development objectives.1194
While calls to rethink economics, progress and innovations aim
at addressing global challenges, they may overlook the resource
constraints and infrastructural shortages of marginalised
communities.1195 The results may remain inaccessible to poorer
nations and groups,1196 risking them falling further behind.
Economically marginalised communities have a track record of
generating sustainable and resource-efficient solutions. Faced
with resource constraints, these communities often innovate
within tight boundaries, showcasing their adaptability and
inventiveness.1197 For example, a clay fridge in India keeps food
fresh for days using evaporative cooling, requiring no electricity.1198
Low-income countries on the frontlines of climate impacts are
generating locally led solutions that can empower communities to
shape and drive responses.1199
Complex global challenges disproportionately affect poor
communities, yet they are not part of the solution. Findings from
the 160 countries covered by the Sendai Framework Monitor
suggest that the lowest-income countries account for 26.6% of
globally reported disaster mortality despite making up only 12.1%
of the population.1200 However, they are often excluded from key
decision-making processes, with one study finding that only 22 of
374 climate adaptation projects featured a locally led approach.1201
In addition, the recent (2023) growth in patent filings from
Ethiopia (28.1%), India (17.2%) and Indonesia (5.9%)1202 highlights

Methodology
Methodology
Metareview Phase
Review Published Trends And Futures
Identify reputable global and regional organisations that publish trends- or future-oriented
reports, seeking a balance across international governmental organisations, academia and
government and private sources.
Extract publications between June 2023 and August 2024.
Review for completeness, credibility and authenticity.
Analyse the contents and extract key messages and data based on research template.
THIS YEAR
We conducted a detailed review of 57 reports (out of an initial total of 88) published by 43
organisations and, this year, including ones from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
region (see Bibliography).
USE OF GENAI
This assessment was supported by the use of multiple GenAI models and platforms to
extract information and supporting quotes from the reports examined, based on a template
questionnaire with specific prompts. All outputs were fact-checked and extended by people.
Interview Phase
Conduct Expert Interviews
Identify experts for roundtable discussions, ensuring coverage across geographies, areas of
expertise, and sectors as well as possible.
Ensure inclusion of experts who did not participate in the roundtables or interviews in other
Global 50 editions and special editions.
Conduct virtual roundtables under the Chatham House Rule with a focus on growth,
prosperity and well-being, seeking answers to open-ended questions such as ‘Irrespective of
where the world is today, what might it look like 50 years from now?’, ‘What is your vision for
the future?’, and ‘What do you hope will happen in the future?’
Carry out thematic coding of fully anonymised transcripts.
THIS YEAR
Six roundtables were conducted between 8 September and 10 October 2024, involving a total
of 24 experts.
USE OF GENAI
The thematic coding of the fully anonymised transcripts was complemented by the use of
multiple generative AI models and platforms to explore different ways to categorise, group,
and build on the scenarios identified by the experts we engaged.

Use internal brainstorming and the analysis from the metareview and interviews to
systematically capture a list of opportunities and questions about the future in a ‘What if?’
statement irrespective of present day trends, second order and third order impacts.
Apply an initial filter of a) negative implications on future growth, prosperity and well-
being; b) understandability; c) benefit; and d) not included in previous Global 50 editions.
Review opportunities with the selection committee for selection.
Apply research quality criteria to conduct research and analysis (some opportunities
change as research is conducted) and assign scope and category (a posteriori).
THIS YEAR
An initial brainstorm generated a total of 492 opportunities.
USE OF GENAI
Multiple GenAI models and platforms were used as part of this exercise, providing prompts
specific to The Global 50 research. Four of the opportunities in this edition were inspired
by GenAI. While multiple generative AI models and platforms were used to assist in finding
recent data on signals and trends, the team reverted back to manual searches to ensure high-
quality sources and relevant data.
